Known LOG bugs.  "*" = supposedly fixed, not yet tested.


   logsimh appears to be causing bus errors, just before the instance
   would have become active.  Name was "P".

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Fix default homedir to use $HOME/log rather than "~/log", and/or
   add support for ~ prefixes in tryfindfile.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Look for na_alloc calls in logsimh and elsewhere, fix to use new/dispose.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Eliminate all uses of the small characters in the old LOG font:
      Gates containing text in their pictures.
      The shift-D command.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Selecting Delete or Box from menus, cursor does not change right away!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Various file names still refer to Chipmunk-specific things like /SPOOL,
   and .text extensions are sometimes added by default.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The mylib window doesn't refresh when the newcrt window is active.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Resizing the mylib screen during startup causes a core dump!
 * Also, using TWM's Zoom Full command causes problems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   When LOG first starts up, hitting "d" immediately puts "DEL" in
   the mode area but does not enter true delete mode until next click.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Catalog screen can't resize.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The four-phase CLOCK doesn't generate the right waveform.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   When I saved using an absolute path, no LFO file was created.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Newcrt drawing is slow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   LIBR screen refreshes after each selection.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Go through and check out every p2c warning message!


========================================================================

   In Unix, the timestep memory limit of the Scope screen should be
   optional.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Can't throw gates off the sides of the window.
