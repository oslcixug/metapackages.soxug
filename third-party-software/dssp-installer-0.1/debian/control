Description: Installer for DSSP application
 The DSSP program was designed by Wolfgang Kabsch and Chris Sander
 to standardize secondary structure assignment. DSSP is a database
 of secondary structure assignments (and much more) for all protein
 entries in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). DSSP is also the program
 that calculates DSSP entries from PDB entries.
