/**
 * This class provides a low-synchronization list of objects.  It is
 * designed to allow proper traversal of the list while objects are
 * being added and/or removed, and to allow simultaneous adds and
 * removals.  Traversals must be done in a single thread; no fair handing
 * off a <code>Node</code> pointer to another thread to continue the
 * traversal!  A single thread cannot perform two or more simultaneous
 * traversals, even if traversing different lists.
 * <p>
 * All this means that users of the list will occasionally see a
 * removed node in the list, because it may be marked removed after it
 * has been reached while traversing the list.  This will be rare, but
 * it is up to the user of the list to skip over nodes that have been
 * removed if necessary, and to handle or avoid attempted re-removal of
 * a node.  This is why <code>remove</code> returns a boolean -- if the
 * node has already been removed by the time the attempt to remove it
 * happens, <code>remove</code> will return <code>false</code>.  This
 * is done synchronizing on the node itself.  A typical piece of code
 * to remove would look like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 *  public synchronized Value findMatch(Value matchFor) {
 *      for (Value val = list.head(); val != null; val = val.next()) {
 *          if (matchFor.matches(val)) {
 *              if (!list.remove(n))   // oh, well -- someone got to it first
 *                  continue;          // keep looking
 *              return val;            // it's ours to take!
 *          }
 *      }
 *      return null;
 *  }
 * </pre>
 *
 * This code assumes that getting a removed node will be rare enough
 * that there is no point in testing for it until a match is found.
 * If testing for a match was expensive, one might
 * <code>synchronize</code> on the node object and test it for being
 * removed and then try for matching, thus preventing any other
 * thread from attempting a match at the same time.  In any case, the
 * <code>remove</code> test is itself atomic -- either it succeeds, or
 * it fails because someone got there first.
 *
 * <p>
 * <i>The Java(TM) Language Specification<i> details a memory model based on
 * local and global memories, apparently intended as a model for
 * multiprocessor caches.  The specified memory model should be
 * supplemented by William Pugh's {@link
 * http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/ work} on the Java
 * programming language memory model and JSR 133.
 * <p>
 * In particular, the <code>volatile</code> keyword offers no practical
 * guarantees.  The lock and unlock operations underlying the
 * <code>synchronized</code> language construct are the primary mechanisms
 * for communicating between threads.  A lock operation forces stale values
 * to be flushed from the locking thread's cache: any values subsequently
 * read by the thread are either read from main memory or are cached values
 * no older than the time the lock was acquired.  An unlock operation forces
 * dirty cache entries to be written to main memory: any values written by
 * the thread up to then must be force-written to main memory before the
 * unlock can complete.
 * <p>
 * In every other respect, access to shared memory by threads is
 * arbitrary.  Updates can happen at any time and in any order.  In
 * particular, if one thread initializes a new Node and adds it to the end
 * of the list, it's possible for a different thread to see the pointer to
 * the new Node but read uninitialized (stale) values for the fields of the
 * new Node (including, ominously, the instance's <code>vptr</code>),
 * because writes can be seen in a different order by another thread.  Even
 * on a uniprocessor, compiler optimizations can cause similar surprises.
 * <p>
 * The removal of a node is decoupled from the unlinking of that node from
 * the list.  The <code>next</code> method unlinks some nodes that have been
 * removed; with reaping, the number of nodes which remain in a list for a
 * long time will be less than the number of threads in the VM.
 * <p>
 * No node can be a member of more than one list.  Nodes which have been
 * added to a list can never be added to another list, even if they are
 * removed from the first list.
 * <p>
 * Never synchronize on an instance of this class - it could lead to
 * deadlock. (See the paragraph on locking order below for explanation.)
 * <p>
 * You can synchronize on an instance of a <code>Node</code> subclass
 * provided that the synchronizing thread does not already hold a lock on
 * another <code>Node</code> instance taken from the same
 * <code>FastList</code>. Note, many of the methods on <code>FastList</code>
 * synchronize on <code>Node</code>s in the
 * list, thus you should not call one of these methods if you
 * already hold a lock on a <code>Node</code> in the list. Similarly
 * for methods on <code>Node</code>.
 * <p>
 * The remainder of this comment discusses the internal structure
 * and assumptions of this class.
 * <p>
 * The design is to have a list of <code>FastList.Node</code> nodes,
 * each of which has a <code>next</code> reference, a <code>removed</code>
 * flag, and a <code>guardSet</code> (indicating which traversals
 * depend on a future synchronization on that node).
 * <p>
 * There is a special sublist which is important to assuring the integrity
 * of this data structure.  The chain of nodes starting at <code>head</code>
 * and continuing to the <code>tail</code> via <code>Node.next</code>
 * references is called the <dfn>main sequence</dfn>.  The fundamental
 * constraints on the main sequence are: <ul>
 * <li> The <code>tail</code> is always reachable from the <code>head</code>.
 * <li> Every <code>Node</code> for which <code>removed==false</code> is
 * an element of the main sequence.
 * <li> Every <code>Node</code> for which
 * <code>guardSet.isEmpty()==false</code> is an element of the main sequence
 * (regardless of <code>removed</code>).
 * <li> <code>tail.next==null</code> whenever <code>tail != null</code>.
 * <li> <code>tail==null</code> if and only if <code>head==null</code>.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Note that removed non-guard nodes can still be in the main sequence:
 * they do not have to be unlinked immediately.
 * <p>
 * We say <q><var>Y</var> is <dfn>reachable</dfn> from <var>X</var></q>
 * when <var>X</var> equals <var>Y</var> or when <var>Y</var> is
 * reachable from <code><var>X</var>.next</code>.
 * <p>
 * New nodes are added at the tail, requiring synchronization on the list.
 * A node is said to be <dfn>removed<dfn> if its <code>removed</code>
 * field is <code>true</code>.  Such a node may still exist and be
 * part of the main sequence.  Removed nodes will eventually be unlinked
 * from their neighbors, if the <code>reap</code> method is called
 * occasionally.
 * <p>
 * Any element can become removed (by the <code>remove</code> method),
 * but once that happens, that element can never revert to being unremoved.
 * This means that the <code>removed</code> field can be read without
 * synchronization: a <code>true</code> value indicates that the node has
 * been removed; a <code>false</code> value is inconclusive.
 * This in turn means that a removed element cannot be added to a
 * <code>FastList</code>, because some other threads may read a stale cached
 * value for its <code>removed</code> field.  (It may be possible, one day,
 * to liberate removed nodes from this restriction, given the guarantees of
 * guarded traversal.)
 * <p>
 * The list can be traversed without much synchronization.
 * When a traversal begins, a node near the end of the main sequence is
 * specially marked (<i>guarded</i>) in order that the traversal will
 * stop and synchronize when it reaches that node.  When the guard node is
 * reached, and there are more nodes in the list to traverse, the
 * procedure is repeated: the (new) last node in the list
 * is marked, and traversal continues.  This procedure ends when the
 * traversal reaches its guard node but finds out that it is still the
 * last node in the list.  In this way, much of the list can be traversed
 * without synchronization.
 * <p>
 * It is possible for a traversal to find itself on an orphaned branch
 * (one from which the <code>tail</code> is not reachable).  This can
 * happen when the <code>restart</code> method is called by a different
 * thread.  Even a node on an orphaned branch is still useful for
 * traversal: every unremoved node which was inserted after the orphaned
 * node but before the traversal originally began is still reachable
 * from the orphaned node.
 * <p>
 * Because every traversal has a guard, a list with at least
 * one node can not become empty by traversal alone, even if the node
 * is removed.  The <code>reap</code> method can remove such nodes.
 * <p>
 * Main-sequence nodes are stored in FIFO order.
 * <p>
 * Synchronized locks are acquired in accordance with the following
 * partial order, in order to avoid deadlocks.
 * <ul><li>Earlier nodes precede later nodes (i.e. where a thread holds
 * the lock on a node <var>X</var>, it must not wait for a lock on any
 * node <var>Y</var> unless <var>Y</var> is reachable from
 * <var>X</var>).</li>
 * <li>Every node precedes the list (i.e. where a thread holds the lock on
 * the <code>FastList</code> itself, it must not wait for a lock on any node
 * which has been added to that list).</li></ul>
 * <p>
 * Each node contain a field (<code>guardSet</code>) which
 * indicates how many different threads are using the node as a guard node.
 * If the field's value is <code>null</code>, the number is zero and the node
 * is not a guard node.  If the field's value is nonnull, the value is a
 * <code>WeakHashMap</code> whose <code>keySet</code> is the set of threads
 * using the node as a guard node.  If that <code>keySet</code> is empty,
 * the node is not a guard node.
 * <p>
 * There is a global table (actually a ThreadLocal) called
 * <code>DynamicGuard</code> which is used to
 * retrieve the guard node for the current thread.  The number of entries
 * in a guard node's <code>guardSet</code> generally corresponds to the
 * number of times that node appears in the global table (the
 * <code>guardSet</code> size temporarily becomes greater
 * than the number of table entries, but it can never be less).
 * The list need not be synchronized while the global table is being accessed.
 * <p>
 * Unsynchronized access may be made to the <code>guardSet</code>,
 * <code>removed</code>, and <code>next</code> fields.  In the case of
 * <code>next</code>, the field may be modified so as to unlink any removed
 * non-guard nodes.  This action does not invalidate the main-sequence
 * invariant, and can only be done by a thread which is holding a lock on
 * the node being unlinked.
 * <p>
 * In the case of <code>guardSet</code> and <code>removed</code>, the fields
 * are read as an optimization.  If the values read from the fields might
 * be stale, then synchronization is done and the old values are not
 * relied on.  The value of <code>guardSet</code> is read without
 * synchronization to see if it's null or not, as part of a check to detect
 * the traversing thread's guard node.  The unsynchronized value of
 * <code>removed</code> is untrusted when it's <code>false</code>; however,
 * a <code>true</code> value is trustworthy, since such a value could only
 * be read after the node is irrevocably marked removed.
