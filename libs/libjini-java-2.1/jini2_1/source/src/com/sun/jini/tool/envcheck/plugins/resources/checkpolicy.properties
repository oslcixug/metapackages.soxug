policyExp=A security policy file should be specified via the \
          java.security.policy system property. RMI requires a \
          security manager to be installed before remote calls can \
          be made; the default set of permissions is generally insufficient, \
          so a customized policy file is usually required.

nopolicy=No security policy file is defined

policyOK=A security policy file is defined and accessible

grantsall=Security policy globally grants AllPermissions

allExp=A security policy which grants java.security.AllPermissions \
       to all protection domains should not be used for \
       deployment.
