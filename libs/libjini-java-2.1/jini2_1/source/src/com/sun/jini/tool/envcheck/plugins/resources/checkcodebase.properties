desc=descriptor for

propsource=java.rmi.server.codebase system property

existenceExp=Remote objects must generally provide implementation specific \
classes and resources to the consumers of the remote \
objects. These implementation specific components are \
typically provided as dynamically downloaded code. \
The codebase defines the URL's needed to access the code, \
and is specified by the java.rmi.server.codebase system \
property.

codebaseIs=The codebase is:
nocodebase=The codebase is NOT defined

nohandler=Codebase component {0} \
specifies an httpmd URL,\n\
but no httpmd URL protocol handler is installed.\n\

httpmdExp=An httpmd URL has been specified; this protocol is \
not recognized by the default URL protocol handlers. \
The required handler may be installed by defining \
the system property java.protocol.handler.pkgs to \
have the value net.jini.url.

badURL=Codebase component {0} is a malformed URL. \n\
       No further checks will be performed for this URL.

noHost=Unknown host ''{0}'' specified in codebase URL {1}

usedLocalhost=Avoid using a loopback address in codebase URL {0}

localhostExp=The use of a loopback address in codebase URLs is strongly \
discouraged. If a remote reference with such an \
annotation is obtained by a different host, the \
endpoint address will resolve to that host rather \
than the exporting host

noresponse=No response from codebase URL ''{0}'' after 5 seconds
available=Codebase resource {0} is accessible
unavailable=Could not access resource at {0}

unqualified=Codebase component {0} should be defined using a fully qualified \
domain name

unqualifiedExp=Objects are annotated with codebase strings exactly as \
defined by the deployer. If codebase strings are not \
fully qualified and a remote reference is obtained \
in a domain other than that in which the reference \
was created, then an attempt to access the codebase \
for that remote reference will fail.

nohash=The codebase httpmd URL does not include a hashcode: {0}
usesmd5=The codebase httpmd URL relies on an md5 hashcode: {0}

usesmd5Exp=The md5 hashcode algorithm has been shown to be potentially \
insecure. It's use is discouraged in favor of the stronger sha algorithm.

badtask=Exception returned by sub process: {0}
