/**
 * ThreadPool is a simple thread pool implementation of the Executor
 * interface.
 *
 * A new task is always given to an idle thread, if one is available;
 * otherwise, a new thread is always created.  There is no minimum
 * warm thread count, nor is there a maximum thread count (tasks are
 * never queued unless there are sufficient idle threads to execute
 * them).
 *
 * New threads are created as daemon threads in the thread group that
 * was passed to the ThreadPool instance's constructor.  Each thread's
 * name is the prefix NewThreadAction.NAME_PREFIX followed by the name
 * of the task it is currently executing, or "Idle" if it is currently
 * idle.
 *
 * <p>This implementation uses the {@link Logger} named
 * <code>com.sun.jini.thread.ThreadPool</code> to
 * log information at the following levels:
 *
 * <p><table summary="Describes what is logged by ThreadPool at
 * various logging levels" border=1 cellpadding=5>
 *
 * <tr> <th> Level <th> Description
 *
 * <tr> <td> {@link Level#WARNING WARNING} <td> uncaught exception in
 * worker thread
 *
 * </table>
