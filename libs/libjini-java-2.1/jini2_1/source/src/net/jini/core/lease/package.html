These are distributed leasing interfaces and classes.  A <CODE>Lease</CODE> represents
an agreement between lease holder and lease grantor over how long the grantor
will keep a resource available.  The grantor pledges to keep the resource
available for at least as long as the remaining time of the lease.  The
holder typically requests a lease for a given time frame, and the grantor
returns a <CODE>Lease</CODE> object that represents the pledge it is actually
willing to make (which may be different from the requested time).  The
grantor may allow the holder to renew the lease, thereby extending the pledge
to a later time.
