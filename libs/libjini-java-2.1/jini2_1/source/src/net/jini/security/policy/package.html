Provides an interface for security policy providers capable of dynamic
permission grants, an interface for security manager or policy providers
that use custom security context state, and a security policy provider
supporting dynamic permission grants.
<p>
The {@link net.jini.security.policy.DynamicPolicy} interface is
implemented by security policy providers that may support dynamic granting of
permissions at run-time.  One such provider is {@link
net.jini.security.policy.DynamicPolicyProvider}, which layers
dynamic grant functionality on top of a "static" security policy provider (that
is, one incapable of dynamic permission grants itself).
<p>
The default static security policy used by <code>DynamicPolicyProvider</code>
is {@link net.jini.security.policy.PolicyFileProvider}: a policy implementation
that wraps the J2SE(TM) default
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/security/PolicyFiles.html">
"PolicyFile" security policy provider</a> distributed as part of the Java(TM) 2
Platform, Standard Edition.  <code>PolicyFileProvider</code> augments the
J2SE default policy provider with convenience constructors as well as support
for a special-cased permission,
{@link net.jini.security.policy.UmbrellaGrantPermission}, which signifies a
{@link net.jini.security.GrantPermission} for all permissions authorized to a
given protection domain.
<p>
The {@link net.jini.security.policy.SecurityContextSource} interface is
intended to be implemented by security managers and policy providers whose
security contexts include state in addition to that provided by
{@link java.security.AccessControlContext}.
