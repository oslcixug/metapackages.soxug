Description: a library which enables you to easily create P2P applications
 JXTA technology is a set of open protocols that allow any connected
 device on the network ranging from cell phones and wireless PDAs to PCs
 and servers to communicate and collaborate in a P2P manner.
 .
 JXTA peers create a virtual network where any peer can interact with
 other peers and resources directly even when some of the peers and
 resources are behind firewalls and NATs or are on different network
 transports.
